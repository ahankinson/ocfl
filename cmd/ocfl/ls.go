	Usage: "List ocfl entities (roots, ojects, versions, files)",
	Description: `Given an identifier of an OCFL entity, list its contents.

	Identifiers may be physical file paths, URIs, logical names, etc.
	For addressing OCFL entities in context (i.e. a specific file
	in a particular version of an OCFL obect), a hierarchy of 
	identifiers can be provided, separated by spaces.

	For example, the following would list files in version v3 of 
	an ocfl object named ark:1234/5678

	  ocfl ls ark:/1234/5678 v3

	Listing can be recursive as well (e.g. listing all versions 
	of an OCFL object, as well as the files in each version), 
	and/or restricted by type (i.e. list all logical files under 
	an ocfl root)`,
	ArgsUsage: "[ file | id ] ...",
